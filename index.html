        <h2>About Me:</h2>
      
        <p> My name is Hal Anderson. I live in South Orange, New Jersey, and I teach flying trapeze in New York City.</p> 
  
  <p>When people ask me what I actually do as a trapeze instructor? It's the following:</p>      
      <div>  
        <ul>
          <li>coaching students</li>
          <li>training staff</li>
          <li>rigging equipment</li>
          <li>rig maintenance</li>
          <li>and the best part of my job, catching people in midair</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
      <p>...but mostly just having fun!</p>

        <p>While I still love trapeze, I am looking to branch out and challenge myself in other ways as well. I am looking for several things in my next endeavour.  </p>
        <ol><li>It has to be something that I enjoy doing.</li>
            <li>It should be something that always presenting new challenges.</li>
            <li>I'd like work that could possibly be done remote some of the time.</li>
            <li>And of course I want decent pay with potential to grow.</li>
        </ol>
       
        <p>When I was in school I always enjoyed my coding classes. I love the challenge of figuring out a soultion to a problem, implementing it, and having it work! I am currently taking a software engineering bootcamp at
          <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/"><strong>Thinkful</strong></a> so that I can put that passion for discovery and problem solving to good use. And I think a  career as a software engineer can satisfy most if not all of the things I'm looking for.</p>
      
        <p>These days I'm spending a lot of time studying and developing coding skill, and when I'm not doing that you can find me swinging high up in the sky of NYC.</p>
